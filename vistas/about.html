                        Mexican entrepreneur Francisco LópezSerrano (b. 1998) is best known for his taste and practice in
                        fashion.
        
                        LópezSerrano spent his childhood in Tepoztlán, Morelos, a tranquil, spiritual place surrounded by
                        nature, an element that notably influences his work.
        
                        From a young age, LópezSerrano was captivated by textile design, frequently manipulating and intervening
                        in pieces with scissors and threads, experimenting and trying to bring unique pieces to life.
        
                        His training as an economist plays a fundamental role inS textile creation and experimentation from a
                        logical perspective, coexisting with an experimental and creative viewpoint, converging in collective
                        identity pieces.
        
                        LópezSerrano does not label himself as an artist or fashion designer; he seeks a balance and harmony
                        between both arts—fashion and painting—aiming to explore the individual intimacy of the observer and
                        their personal relationship with the work.
